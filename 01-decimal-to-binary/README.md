## Problem: 
*Write an algorithm, draw a flow chart and write its corresponding C program to convert a
decimal number to its equivalent Binary number.*

### Algorithm

* Step 1 : Start
* Step 2 : Read the number ‘num’
* Step 3 : [Initialize]
remainder, binaryArray, i<-0
* Step 4 : Repeat Steps 5 to 7 until n greater than zero
* Step 5: Divide the number by 2 using % ( modulus operator ) and store the result in a variable called ‘remainder’.
* Step 6: Divide the number by 2 using / ( division operator ) and store the result in a variable called ‘num’.
* Step 7: Increment the value of variable i by one.
* Step 8: [Initialize]
j<-i-1,
* Step 9 : Repeat Steps 10 to 11 until j is greater than equal to zero.
* Step 10 : Print jth item of the binaryArray
* Step 11 : Decrement the value of j by one.
* Step 2 : Stop
